# AryaMehr PyBuster 🕵️‍♂️🔍

A fast, multi-threaded, GUI-based directory and file busting tool built with Python. PyBuster is designed to help security researchers, penetration testers, and developers discover hidden paths and directories on web servers.

## ✨ Features

* **User-Friendly GUI**: Built entirely with Tkinter and styled with `ttkthemes` for a clean, modern interface.

* **Granular Status Code Filtering**: Easily toggle visibility for specific HTTP response codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, or show all including 404s).
* **Evasion & Stealth**: Automatically rotates through a predefined pool of modern User-Agents for every request to bypass basic blocks and filters.
* **Export Capabilities**: Save your scan results locally in `.txt` or `.csv` formats for reporting and further analysis.
